"it usually ranges on which size has the most stock, which varies on every drop but the smaller sizes usually have the lower stock levels",N

Not necessarily about getting out of my head just books you think are good to read in general,N
message the buyer and let them know you’ll issue a full refund and just re list it.,N
How should I go about an eBay refund if I had a typo in a listing and it’s not the item they want? (edited),N
Unless you’re gonna do HIIT or something the only thing you need to change is your diet and do more cardio,N
If the goal is to cut and keep strength you wanna keep trying to lift as heavy as you do now while properly putting yourself in a calorie deficit,N
Anybody got a good weight lifting program they’d recommend for cutting/losing weight?,N
Hello everyone! I will be joining this fitness community once Ramadan is over and once I move into my new apartment!,N

Do you have any other cash out groups thst big items,N
Like@Apple products and electronics,N
Cash out kings also does apple and other electronics!,N
Hey so I have a method imma share with you bot guarantee,N
Yeah I know plenty of people like that as well. One of my close friends hasn’t come back here since we both left the Air Force in 2017. He’s in Thailand.,N
Another thing I would consider is cost of living and community.,N
"Cost of living is hella low in places like Columbia, Thailand, Philippines and Panama.",N
Are you considering the weather and culture as well?,N
I don’t know a lot about Canada personally but know that Portugal is also a good place for expats.,N
"Dubai provides the most amount of opportunity and best lifestyle, while also providing the least amount of culture shock imo. I also know people who have relocated to Australia, Philippines, and Thailand.",N
But I’d more so like to get insight on your experience,N
Nah I’ve never been before,N
hi (plz dont respond back to this),N
"Yea I’m a seller on whatnot, I could probably get you more on eBay though",N
Amazing I’m looking to sell one. You mentioned something called whatnot right?,N
hi - you mentioned you could help me sell my panini prizm fotl box right?,N
this was like a few weeks back,N
Not understanding the holier than thou attitude,N
I just felt compelled to tell you lol,N
Yea lol it’s whatever I know people can have different opinions on different things. I just wasn’t expecting that response from here,N
nothing but a potential good time,N
"Lmk where you end up going! Just curious, I like to hear about places",N
Yeah I’ve traveled solo for work a ton and to places I’ve lived before where I have a lot of friends but I’ve never traveled solo internationally,N
So is this your first solo trip you’re trying to do?,N
I would definitely just be going to an all inclusive resort and living my best life on the property + go on group excursions,N
I need to get rid of some of these lol,N
FActs that’s why I let my off,N
I’ll ask around tho,N
I have multiple and when I asked he said no sadly,N
When you said you were selling your FOTL box did you mean that panini one with lamelo ball on the box,N
Sweet thanks for messaging me,N
Hey! Sorry I clicked the link they texted me but they didn’t give me any approve or deny options so I assumed everything was good,N
amazon apprenticeship starts in june,N
I was so close to dropping out too but my prof talked me out of it lol,N
"thank you so much duke, i been off discord a lot havent really had the time with classes",N

There’s a Pinterest one coming soon too,N

"other than that i run mushroom, donut, and for isp bart or red dirt",N
Doing well!! Sad I’m not at the show tonight,N
But I made it back home and immediately slept 4 hours,N
"tbh, Im a little disappointed cause I accidentally bet spread on a couple tickets that should've been ML",N

Go see Silk Sonic tomorrow!!!!!!!!!!,N
That was my dog they shoulda never banned him in the first place…. Now look,N
People pride always get in the way of good shit for whatever reason,N
I was riding my bike and came home my water heater busted so it’s been a night,N
Yeah but it’s all good. Nothin I could do about it but I’m cleaning everything out and so are both my neighbors,N
Last time it said this they had nothing but I’m gonna check,N
Yeah I was gonna message you and see what your thoughts were on the whole thing,N
Yeah exactly help some people out instead of posting 60 pairs of shoes while we can’t get 1,N
It’s like I get it you know what you’re doing but at this point everyone knows what you’re doing at least share some tips,N
Yeah I tried to get a second one on a newer account that had been doing good recently and it got canned,N
Alright fam I drank too much caffeine late at night so I literally haven’t gone to bed yet so I’m gonna wake up and hope these orders stick,N
Only 2 caffeinated drinks in 24 hours has me up until 6am smh,N
Yeah imma pray with you. Thank you again! And I’m probably up for the day myself it looks like,N
Yeah I didn’t think I was getting this many until I checked my room yesterday,N
But I’m still selling like 4 a week so I’ll be fine. If anything I’ll just drop my price,N
Just made another account for target hopefully the order doesn’t get clipped,N
"Yeah but not for what you make local haha
",N
Hmm I may end up selling some tho cause I have like 15 left,N
Their is so many consoles this year it’s insane,N
I only have 3 accounts though rip,N
And Richmond northwest and Richmond brandermille,N
Well I don’t have access to the guides so I’m figuring it out on my own  seems simple enough but I’ll have a more accurate answer after (hopefully) Target Friday,N
Of course if you need more help just message me I dont mind helping,N
chance it'll be second wave though since it says can be backordered,N
not sure how price will do on the set short term but wouldn't expect over $150 out the gate. More likely to be moving for $130,N
Keep an eye on Shining Fates prices going forward. TCGplayer showing a solid price increase since December,N
I would also still be looking at Burning Shadows and Evolving Skies as strong holds,N
Good price on Brilliant Stars if yall want some,N
Has vmax climax for 87-90 per box if anyone was looking,N
For example best set at $105 bc shops got slammed with supply by pc and distributors. I’d expect smaller shops to sell near or at a loss for the next set as well just to keep cash flow up,N
Been a minute since I posted in here but just wanted to say be careful with buying modern pokemon on release and preordering rn.,N
Stock for the last couple of sets just got dumped on the market so I'd assume they're caught up with printing.,N
Could see prices dip from preorders on release and even more on following waves (If they're still doing waves).,N
I'm waiting to see what prices do on wave 1 of the new set before making any purchases though.,N
"To be clear it is a dope set though, just a matter of not overpaying",N
Good price if you wanna hold,N
Holiday season might be a good time to unload anything you don't want to hold longterm,N
Don’t know how I feel about it yet but I’d hold out on preorders when they start popping up (edited),N
If anyone sees this listing don’t buy. The guy is 99.9% scamming,N
So now that celebrations is winding down I doubt there will be any more big releases for a while.,N
"My expectations is until the last set of Sword & Shield every other set will be anywhere from bad to decent, with maybe one being a better set than Vivid Voltage.",N
"In the meantime, there are a few plays to be made for quick flips and long term holds:",N
Quick flips are basically going to be limited to any early morning pokemoncenter restocks on old etbs.,N
hese are usually minimum 2x flips and have been as high as 4x depending on the etb.,N
I'd make tasks for each etb and have notifications on for pokemon-center and pokemon-center-2.,N
Other than that the only low risk quick flips I can see are japanese high class boxes at good prices (60-70$ shipped) and flipping those in the US for $100+.,N
"Margins won't be great on ebay, but again local and fb marketplace are where we wanna be anyways.",N
"For Long term holds, the best plays imo are evolutions below $700 per booster box and Burning Shadows below $325 per booster box.",N
Evolutions is now out of rotation so prices should be going into a slow rise as supply drops.,N
"Burning Shadows goes out of rotation 8/22/22 so we have time, but prices could start rising at anytime.",N
Burning Shadows in particular is a layup long term since the booster box is currently cheaper than the chase card ($400+),N
"Personally, I'll be focusing on off loading some of my weaker purchases for small to break even gains and picking up the first edition versions of the first two metazoo sets.",N
I'll still keep y'all posted on what I'm buying but expecting things to slow down for a while (edited),N
Just saw on fb. Not a bad price for a pc etb if you’re looking to hold and couldn’t cop,N
Sword and shield base set etbs popping up in Walmart’s. Personally that’s a pass to me and expect base set sword and shield products to tank,N
Newer game shop about a year old but takes PayPal,N
Posted this a week or so back and they had 23 available then,N
Not saying it’s a must buy but not a bad price to guarantee you get one in case the drop goes to shit,N
Vmax climax Japanese high class box preorder for $50,N
Has the new character rares. This box will contain most of the hits so should be a nice flip when it releases and up to the release of the English set,N
Personally passing bc of capital reasons,N
No cancellations once you order though,N
Main takeaway is that character rares are coming in the set after fusion strike. The character rares from previous sets should increase in value as well as the boxes that contain them,N
Personally interested to see what the vmax chunkachu does for vivid voltage @Cards,N
From @Hands AIO zekrom box will be available on Friday at 2pm for pro members at gamestop. Should be able to go through the website or order from instore (edited),N
With stock on celebrations becoming clearer I’d focus on grabbing only certain products in store for quick flips,N
The set seems to be heavily printed and is a very small set to begin with.,N
I’d focus on flipping etbs and maybe a small amount of the pikachu box and Lance’s charizard box,N
"Other than that keep an eye out for restocks on PC exclusive etb, pikachu figure boxes, Amazon prime box, and ultra premium boxes.",N
As we’ve been saying we want the items that won’t be available at big box stores.,N
I’m focusing on products with some other draw besides celebrations packs as well (pika figure and gold cards),N
Some numbers on how easy it'll be to complete celebrations set.,N
"If you don't want to hold, the first 2-3 weeks are going to be the best time to quick flip.",N
"Hold Time: At least 1 year but the longer the better. Lower supply gets, the more of a seller's market it becomes",N
"This set isn't on most people's minds right now since Evolving Skies and Celebrations are here, but I expect Burning Shadows to start rising as soon as January 2022.",N
Wanted to give everyone the heads up to start accumulating.,N
"The evolutions call was relatively short notice, but we have almost a year for this set.",N
I personally will probably start buying in November after MetaZoo and Parallel are done.,N
Carried by Charizard card so price fluctuates based on card value,N
Had a reprint last year and restock this year so additional supply is unlikely,N
Down $150 on Booster Box and under $100 for Elite Trainer Box,N
Similar to Evolutions this will be a hold as long as you possibly can and sell when you need capital type of investment.,N
Not as great of a set as Evolutions but almost as collectible due to it having the first ever rainbow Charizard.,N
We have about a year before the set goes out of print and we start transitioning to a seller's market.,N
Project Piplup JP promo card w/25th anniversary marking dropped on PC JP.,N
Comes with any purchase from the site. Selling on ebay for cheap rn around $6-10 per card.,N
Could do well depending on how many end up getting made but definitely a long hold imo,N
Amiami is a Japanese retailer and they had eevee heroes boxes for retail a couple weeks ago.,N
The link isn’t up rn. But they’re restocking other products so it might be up and live in the next couple of days,N
Main things I’m buying for the rest of the year for TCGs,N
Celebrations (non retail items/exclusive items),N
Parallel alpha (singles and pack drop),N
Eevee heroes (under 120),N
Evolving skies wave 2&3 (120 or lower),N
Shiny star V reprint (under 120),N
Vivid voltage booster boxes (130 or lower),N
Gonna run the numbers for evolving skies tonight but everyone should be holding something from that set,N
Preorders for the next Pokémon set fusion strike are starting to pop up.,N
I’m passing on this set as I don’t think it’ll do that well.,N
I’d wait until release to see what happens and just flip etbs if it turns out to do well,N
In Pokémon world fb group some pretty decent prices on popular jp products. If anyone is interested,N
expect prices to dip a little since this is the 2nd wave but PC Japan closed down for CV last time I checked so next wave won't be for a while if ever @Cards good buy imo (edited),N
If you bought evolving skies preorders to flip prices going up rn. Preorders at msrp are drying up and shops charging 140-160 per booster box.,N
I’d expect prices to drop as more waves come out but if you’re holding it’s a good sign. I plan to get a couple cases during wave 3 if prices dip enough,N
Scroll down to other sellers and select Amazon,N
This is a hold not a quick flip,N
Selling for 130-150 rn and going up in the future,N
Got off the phone with my go to gamestop and apparently both instore AND web will be pro members only @Cards non members will only be able to get leftovers on Saturday. Sorry for the pings,N
So for Gamestop tomorrow some stores are saying pro members only for instore preorder some are saying it’s all online.,N
Online doesn’t have premium box or pikachu figure so prioritize gs exclusive box and etbs.,N
Also lances charizard box is good if they give you the option to choose.,N
Gamestop website has pages up for celebrations tomorrow. I'd bot and go manual it's gonna be crazy,N
"To be clear only buying at retail is a quick flip, the higher you buy the longer you hold",N
So all in all the Marnie Box has about $100-120 of value at most depending on how the values of the promo card and the packs grow with time.,N
The good thing is sealed pokemon is always worth more than the actual value inside.,N
"Since Marnie is not only the fan favorite, but the player favorite for supporter cards, a lot of cards will be played and taken out of mint condition",N
That is the best case scenario for any card. Less boxes usually,N
More cards and potential devaluation of the card.,N
These are going to be Less boxes and good condition cards as time passes so I can see the promo being around $40-75 (maybe $100) as time passes.,N
I'd still try to target these at under $80 as we still haven't seen if these will ever hit retail in the future.,N
Main risk at buying at the current box value is the price of the promos could drop if more supply is introduced.,N
3 days have passed since the evolutions calls and booster boxes back at $750 listed and hitting 900 on auctions.,N
"ikely bc of celebration artwork being revealed and having that fatass pikachu head on the artwork, people are stopping the mini dump.",N
"they got a privacy setting on there, you might have turned it on by accident or they might have done some weird shit and enabled it",N
Not sure if anyone is still interested in stepn but this guy Shares codes I just used one of these,N
did anyone win the raffle for Akumu? Winners have been selected,N
Good stuff! We should see some wild price action tomorrow,N
Makes me happy I'm still holding my foxes and degod tho,N
Speaking of degods...That merch so fire,N
"Also, idk if anyone would be interested in group buying nfts but I’ll have at least two prysyms and I’d be good with donating one to the group to start doing group buys",N
Anybody claim their optimism airdrop yet?,N
"55k supply, too many normies spending the last of their liqudity trying to get into anything yuga related",N
And anytime eth dumps people panic sell NFTs,N
And BTC looks like it’s gonna do the dash straight to hell,N
Literally a recipe for disaster in every way I see it,N
"I think eth dumps, people panic sell NFTs + liquidity sucked out market with all these cash grab drops. Eth stabilizes and we might see a little NFT relief some months from now.",N
But if you remember eth at ATH NFTs was super ded again. I think that’ll be the nail in the coffin once we’re back to up only,N
might mint this kitbash just to feel something lol,N
Secondary has low volume but at least the floor isn't falling hard.,N
"That's what I was thinking, and possible future AL with collabs.",N
ya i'm still debating. price is high but for only 1k supply could be worth it maybe.,N
I don't want to talk about how much I paid in gas though... lol,N
Then there were another 18K+ pending transactions after sellout that are all gonna fail. KYC ended up being pretty pointless.,N
over 100 mil in gas... yea miners are cleaning up tonight.,N
150 million refund? These MFs have unlimited capital,N
I’m curious why they didn’t use a more gas optimized contract,N
"That’s been the meta for a while now, suprised they ain’t use it",N
I’m curious why they didn’t use a more gas optimized contract,N
do you think raid party fighters is a good buy rn or should I just get a hero?,N
I haven’t paid attention to how the community is responding to the updates. But building a team will be your best bet to get started.,N
They announced 350e rewards for the new season leaderboard. More details today I think so another announcement incoming,N
Majority of the people that have been in RP early are down bad. They bought at top so buying in down here you could build a whole team for like .5,N
Heroes were .3 maybe like a day or 2 ago. 0.47 now so people are circling back,N
like .15-.2 eth is meh tho so its not too much of a miss lol,N
"This could be huge. They are essentially in the process of creating a new type of collab-land verification bot that, if implemented, will be all over discord",N
Bought a founders pass last night at .29. We are currently sitting on a .475 floor.,N
ATH was 1.5 before the deed drop. I’d keep this on y’all’s radar.,N
The floor is surprisingly holding above mint but volume is extremely low. I think I'm passing,N
They just pumped and hit 20 eth is there something that came out ?,N
I’m guessing this is the genesis collection since there was talk of a larger collection he’ll be dropping,N
27 sales until we hit 1eth; less than 24 hrs after the deed drop,N
Multisig Wallet. Probably going to use prysym to manage the governance of it,N
Paid for my nft several times over between giveaways and wl spots,N
"Won a free bff bracelet, cpg club pop (upcoming) , in person events, group buys , etc",N
I have decided no more buying into second collections thing you’ll get the same value as the original. Was probably stupid to think that in the first place but still,N
im going for a few more in the city. Looking for the galleria area now lol,N
"if you can do dates, i heard maybe sumn like sep09.eth, nov22.eth, etc kind of set up like that can MAYBE be something down the line",N
Genesis collection 24 eth floor will prob be a good cook,N
"They have another raffle I think, this the public one",N
got a link for the one without the 3e requirement?,N
"Gotta be in discord already, but not much difference in requirement. Need 2.5 eth",N
I got the alpha role but somehow overlooked the premint link,N
This was some bs in my hidden folder that got sent to me but someone sent a 0.25 offer thru polygon.,N
I usually leave those things alone but I never seen one get an offer like that.,N
Because a lot of people feel even though the tools are nice anybody can use them so why would people buy a FFF,N
"If I’m being completely honest, people don’t really care about utility. It’s just a buzzword used when the floor is down.",N
Hyped projects unfortunately is where the money will go. That’s the beauty of the space,N
Everybody chasing that BAYC “branding” meta because that’s what’s successful,N
More than 50% of the influencers I saw going hard for bears faded Degods lol,N
Also kinda weird to me that they just happened to drop on the same day OS went live with pulling volume from other marketplaces. Lol.,N
Prolly not till he announces WL for the next project. They been teasing so I expect this to go a lil higher,N
"Gonna do a free tools week, then switch from using foxy to sol for non holders. Free tools for holders",N
To collect data on which tools are most used etc and give folks a free trial to FFF tools,N
"I looked a little more on Twitter, it may not be a scam. Could be just a project sending out the NFTs and offers as a form of marketing",N
And that was if you copped on secondary within first 10 mins,N
"I think there are eth natives backing the project from the shadows. They were hyped as a mint on solana, but so have about 5-6 other projects in the last month. ",N
What makes it particularly interesting to me is how they were pushed to the forefront by OS (leading back to my point about there being eth natives backing from the shadows). ,N
"It's a given that people looking for ""the BAYC of solana"" would feel the closeness at first glance",N
I think that last point is what truly caused the FOMO...they were #1 on the 24hr OS leaderboard,N
Especially to the point of OS showing volume from other exchanges for it (edited),N
Trying to figure this out especially since they locking the ape lol,N
There is also the rumored marketplace that could drop right after the mint. All sales in APE,N
Coin base has only had around 1k in sales of volume,N
Honestly I wouldn’t buy anything from coinbase market is higher and like mike said above they only have 1k in trade volume,N
Pro-Tip: if you have a mac & iPhone. Copy on mac then paste the code directly to your phone. Got in the discord today; got a code 5 mins later.,N
Bruh which 4-5 digit ens names are still available? Swear I’ve been trying different combos all day lol,N
a bot bought that listing for 40 and accepted offer for 240 in same block (edited),N
Will be interesting to see when it goes. I think 2.5 at min.,N
I think a lot of people fudding cause they bought the top at 3-4 and alien frens hasn’t passed it since it happened (edited),N
Wow .25 is mint,N
Market may not get the use case but it ain’t going for no .25,N
Also which meta hero projects that low sheesh,N
"I think squishiverse could do the dash, I think I may buy back in once these bigger mints are done",N
Capsule house has been underperforming given they just had another hatchening,N
Damn Akus up to 4.2 before auction even starts,N
"smh, yea I wouldn't have guessed Squishiverse would have outperformed Wonderpals so far.",N
Floor on genesis items (Bags and High Tops) at .925.,N
that's some of the evidence people have seen suggesting direct ties to the BAYC ecosystem.,N
I scooped up like 2 at .25 when I saw this theory for the ties with the BAYC game,N
"I've still got 2 bags and 2 high tops. One of them I bought back at .35, but the rest were minted.",N
The floor on the Super Clean Cotton Cloth items is currently .23.,N
Those are the only items you need to craft blank socks (floor .33) since you can use the tools that are staked by others.,N
Then the floor on the socks goes up to .94 if you own from the eligible collection and are able to craft. ,N
Why not just consolidate and do 1 bid? Lmao,N
so minimum bid is 2.27 currently,N
Auction will randomly end between 12pm-3pm EST,N
"Every 10 mins past 12pm there's a 5% chance the auction ends, it's randomized",N
100 raffle winners for galverse holders:,N
I considered selling an akutar and bidding 4 when lowest was around 2.5 lol,N
Expected people to chill once dutch was announced...they went harder lol,N
You going for any more akutars in auction? Feels like it’s gonna be big gas war,N
2 chapter 3's sold this morning for 50k and 59k,N
Ima mint when they fix contracts they been having issues,N
should we sell our pets since theres gonna be a whole new batch in 7 days,N
imma just running the bot for my locked jewel atp,N
Have y’all used that onboard ramp with dfk yet?,N
Yea what I was thinking. Gonna throw 50$ lol,N
Realistically you’re gonna have to wait until a bottom forms to buy i,N
If I wasn’t getting free money from the pool I’d be sick,N
"Is there a chance this can ever bounce back is the real question...I can't sell, I just can't lol",N
yea its tough cuz if you want a pure gene miner youre going to get taxed,N
These new quests added a whole new dynamic to heroes and their valuation,N
I feel it gave heroes a lot more value. Now any hero can be used effectively,N
And now I'm stuck between which quests to do.  The fact that these are out means less people are going to do profession quests. So now items got more value in my opinion,N
I can tell weapons and equipment about to cost alot of gold by how much they giving out on these quests lol,N
"i'll prob end up keeping it regardless, theres a 75% chance i get what i want, 7% for a dready, or 34% for a dragoon or sage back. i feel like that can be useful down the line",N
Low key that warrior will be great as a tank for PvP and pve. His stat bonues are nice. WIS increases magic defense and VIT determines health. Endurance gonna come naturally too plus I imagine youre gonna focus it when you level.,N
"nah i literally pulled 50 bucks lol, i realized yesterday i didnt even know how to dump if i wanted to lmao",N
"status update, you have to convert the jewel to wrapped avax before sending to avax chain, clearly a vital step I didn't catch yesterday,",N
"i think i just took in too much info at once yesterday and needed to sleep on it, great success with small transfer to ftx",N
If I sell all my eggs (4) I can try and summon for a dread knight,N
Where does everyone offload their one to? Trying to figure out easiest method to get jewel to tether in wallet when time comes,N
"gonna dive into it tonight, got a lab and some comp sci hw to take care of plus trying to get dfk situated. only really glanced at it rn",N
Anyone know how to move usdc on harmony mainnet via metamask? Tried via binance and Crypto.com but address to deposit isn’t valid,N
Tried converting into one and sending to a exchange too,N
This is what I get when I enter my Crypto.com harmony wallet,N
Weird cause I used the same Crypto.com wallet to send to metamask and play defi kingdom,N
u can try bridging through the docks on dfk so like swap that usdc to avax then bridging to avax and send it like that for example,N
Wait I think I can bridge my 1usdc to ERC20 via horizon,N
what’s 0x? I see it as a hash on harmony explorer,N
"Reverse diamond on btc starting to really show, interesting week maybe?",N
"So we apeing or what, I’ve started buying back more and more spot",N
"guess so consensus seems like up for now. eth should lead, i like avax over sol",N
"Gm Gm like in what sense, market cap or overall price?",N
Need another Uncle Sam shill tweet to get the ball rolling again.,N
This is flipping doge,N
Already getting shilled on Tiktok lol,N
"Rejected from here toward midrange, retested and bounced from here lol might get the continuation higher now",N
"Just need to catch one of the miners when they release for retail, they go for about 500, set that up and snowball from there",N
Didn’t someone post a helium guide in here a min ago?,N
"Also have 2 different size antennas coming in today, excited to see the differences play out",N
"So far amazing honestly, the whole dip in the market kinda messed with my first weeks analysis but seeing it for what it is now I highly recommend",N
"Gm gang gang, just wanted to check in, 1 helium miner turned into 6",N
It’s easy money the dude who put me on literally just hydrates off of his initial deposit it literally replaced his 9-5 income,N
I fw drip heavy got put on in November need more before I drop it in the faucet,N
i like that little push ETH just did.,N
you guys think sol is dead?,N
Shit getting volatile,N
But yeah the VC claims are true it’s in the top 5 most common among hedge funds and the like,N
Solana’s network is running into the problems caused by not doing the things Ethereum does,N
And when half your value proposition is not being that it’s in a bad spot,N
I’m not sure how true the claims are of a bunch of VCs in the $Sol community. But the network does go down often which is bad,N
P jewel,N
will SOL/mSOL have a 10:1 c ratio as well,N
It will have to same ratio as FAB so currently 2:1,N
Also what’s the emissions cut proposal,N
Saving fab for supporting btc/fbtc and similar pools will be beneficial.,N
can imagine only earning like 5-10% apy would be enough to get people to provide liquidity.,N
"I think it’s good to have additional collateral, and Sol seems sensible.",N
"I also think it’s good to encourage Fab to be the main collateral by having rewards, so that there is utility in Fab and the price is likely to rise.",N
"But what will be the incentive for anyone to actually stake Sol in the platform, other than it benefitting the platform.",N
Well we can't do anything with the LP or 3 pool until they run their course,N
But currently the dapp is emitting 500k FAB every epoch.,N
We haven't agreed any numbers but we're thinking of cutting that quite dramatically,N
"The incentive atm from what I see, is it allows people to still take part in the ecosystem and the 3pool without the high risk of price fluctuations with fab.",N
So... My little demon in my shoulder is telling me to leverage my fab deposits to get these rewards before they drop...,N
"Well, you could mint some fUSD with your staked SOL, that's something cool to do",N
"If you're bullish on SOL, you could take some leverage in SOL with the minted fUSD",N
bought some punks but cant verify on grape.. i think its bc of the cold wallet i use?!,N
I have a ledger and punks in it but haven’t tried to verify yet.,N
I’m sure somebody will help or point you to the right direction soon,N
My little risk manager in me says don't leverage an illiquid coin,N
"GM fam, whats the plan to peg fUSD again, i mean how do we want to get people to invest in our synths if 70% of the PnL is cut in the more and more unbalanced 3Pool.",N
"whats scratching my head at is what would be the right feedback loop, my gut tells me new synths and more collateral makes it even worse. Because the profits it eg Nasdaq cant be cashed out ",N
"Are they also to list the fSynth tokens as collateral, maybe in a own isolated pool ?",N
"I think for the moment they are just interested in fUSD, but we will discuss with them further. It's still early in discussions",N
"Great ty for all your answers, just another Q - could we onboard some talented alpha caller / technical trader, so we might build up some social trading like of thing where everyone follows fQQQ and fSPY calls",N
Welcome to the club then! At these prices could be very high profits once we recover,N
Pretty sad what happened but I think that prices can recover if we all put some effort in it.,N
"And from my limited time in here, I think that's what happening right now.",N
So yeah the risk/reward at these prices is pretty good,N
We used to play games for punks and coins.,N
but will be pushing some slight changes to the dapp rewards system shortly,N
My 40 punks or so will b chilling for a long time so just keep doin what u must,N
Downside of this is less emissions > less incentive to keep liquidity in fab pools > no liquidity in the protocol > heat death,N
is it still best to keep c ratio ~15? Or anything changed?,N
"That is a risk, but with token price supressed rewards are so low anyway.",N
LP rewards remain and new collateral is being added so we believe its a fairly balanced change,N
got a couple of thousand fab in my wallet waiting to stake again,N
do i need to keep my c-ratio around 15?,N
I would currently recommend a c ratio of 4.,N
I may load up on FAB and then use that as a leverage play to buy more punks,N
All it took before was 1 day to get from .002 back to .01,N
Apparently you can bounce checks at banks then transfer to coinbase and then if you buy crypto and send to a wallet they can’t retrieve the money,N
What I actually think is happening is coinbase earns more money by having my liquidity on their app so they make up a random holding time,N
But US bank system is like 20 years behind from what I've heard,N
No it’s because people are withdrawing USDC from the 3pool,N
"But even then, you're taking over a 50% loss doing that - why?",N
"We've been scratching our heads trying to work out why users are withdrawing USDC, seemingly against their own interest",N
I have no good answer to that besides liquidity issues,N
"that trade is very much against them, but they may need the liquidity",N
"So we would need a mechanism to peg it, other than incentivized lp pools",N
And as we have seen before might depeg fusd into the other direction,N
The other question is why not add USDC to the pool.,N
"$100 USDC to the pool, you get approx $200 worth of share in the LP.",N
And currently our 3 pool has the highest rewards % on Mercurial,N
Once you have the system set up you can arb trade multiple platforms so keeping the peg is easy,N
"But since you are collateralizing only with a volatile asset, you will always be suspect to price fluctuations and therefore problems in the peg",N
DAO vote will go up later today.,N
But we are looking at adding more collateral to diversify,N
And then price fluctuations from FAB aren't such a major issue,N
Perfect. If I could Id buy more now,N
"As of next epoch reward are reduced 5 times, so supply shock may be coming soon",N
Been quite hyped tbh got some cool stuff in the works for FAB this week and beyond.,N
"I have a small amount of fab in the claimable section on the dapp, but it keeps not letting me claim it",N
I got liquidated some fab the only time I was below 2 a little while ago,N
"No, it’s at 3.68",N
Is your c ratio below 2 ser?,N
We pushed an update yesterday so you cannot claim if you are under collateralized,N
I never saw that payout yesterday,N
Hasn't been sent yet we were more focused on pushing the fix last night. Punk payouts will go out today,N
One of you guys has a stepn code for a fellow fab enjoyer?,N
There is no incentive until there is hope of a repeg,N
Any USDC put in the pool is a donation of exit liquidity to FUSD bag holders,N
I have a bunch of USDC I've been looking to park somewhere with nice return. Been hoping FUSD could recover as the merc pool had good returns,N
I know it's a bit of an unfortunate circular problem tho,N
What's the plan to make up for the imbalance in TVL versus FUSD?,N
"It’s 201.9k fUSD. The way that gets burned is liquidations of the positions with excess, but you cascade the price down by doing so",N
So it has to be done in small amounts over time,N
Are the liquidations not running? The price has steadily been moving in the opposite direction since the issue was identified,N
Liquidations have not been running for some time due to the high risk of a liq cascade. They will carefully run as we gain the liquidity required to run them.,N
"Ah, I see. Hopefully this bull trap lasts long enough to raise the alt coin tides",N
I think market may also be reacting to the fact we've just slashed FAB inflation by a factor of 5,N
"Tbf outlook is quite bullish, we have a partnership in the works with a well known defi platform, plus some updates and overhauls coming over the next 2 weeks",N
Looks like Slowlana. Seems that the RPC is behind in slots. I'm guessing network is being overloaded atm,N
"It's a safety mechanism, it won't let you put through txns if the RPC is behind",N
guys is single side staking available?,N
anyone here having problems with magic eden rn?,N
Well atm we don't want to use it because of the 1:1 relation of USDC to fUSD would even more fUSD floating around when that's an issue we're actively trying to resolve.,N
"Nah its gonna be held in USDC. We just forgot to swap it to USDC lol, I'll put through a ton request today to swap it",N
"Long term there's not really an issue, more a case of trying to balance incentives.",N
Hows treasury gonna hold up with 1 sol royalties lol,N
i am gonna stock up until 1 sol floor than just will be waiting for to see what happens to the floor simple plan simple gains,N
Yeah I'm gonna be stocking up on them 0.3 SOL is still insanely cheap imo,N
Somebody sold 1 million fab,N
"oh well, more cheap coins for me I ain't complaining",N
"I’m about to get to my goal of 100k fabs finally, felt impossible last year lol",N
Its going to be so awesome looking back in a year when we all made it and are in the next bullmarket. Knowinf we bought our punks and fab so low.,N
Always been bullish on this. Now more than ever,N
Hello Can you change telegram in coincapmarket ?,N
We'll run a list of all the wallets that failed and resend them tonight,N
Del is possible to see which accounts have the largest amount on minted fUSD and who have been delinquent the longest?,N
I just figured if we have to do liquidations might as well go after the people causing the largest majority of the issue,N
I did wonder that now we've cut off rewards whether fUSD would drop. But doesn't seem like that's happened.,N
So it's looking like the majority of the debt is probably being held by people who abandoned the protocol,N
"Although saying that, if the current price trend continues we won't have to liquidate them",N
Well I will be purchasing more in the near future,N
So don’t get the price ramped up too much,N
I'm waiting for some SOL to clear and I'm grabbing some,N
"Hi guys, where do we stake our nft?",N
"Ok thanks, how do we earn the FAB token?",N
"In order to get them initially you will need to buy them. Once you have them, you can stake either in our DAPP or LP pool to earn sweet FAB yield daily",N
but fabric was working on the utility the entire time lol,N
